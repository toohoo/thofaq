little FAQ in Perl 
-- was uploaded on GitHub at 08.03.2016 by thomas@th-o.de
-- This should really be a very small FAQ app for someone
who wants to save some ideas. The app is runable on any
Webserver including a local installation on XAMPP on Wondows 
or similar. The development is not going continiously as 
might be expected. The application includes an over all
search as well as tag-list and tag-cloud. In the difference
the tag-list is a simple mention whereas the tag-cloud
has a weight in size, how often the tag is used. The data
are - at the moment - viewable by everyone but editable 
only from registered users.
Would be nice if someone does find errors and tell me.
Have fun.
Attention: For use immediately on Windows there is set 
a shebang for correctly work with XAMPP on Windows. The 
assumed prerequest is XAMPP on drive D and perl in 
/xampp/perl/bin/perl
To run it on Linux/Unix just remove the first line at 
the perl scripts.
The app is tested under Linux/Windows/Raspbian.
