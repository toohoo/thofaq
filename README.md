little FAQ in Perl 
-- was uploaded on GitHub at 08.03.2016 by thomas@th-o.de
-- This should really be a very small FAQ app for someone
who wants to save some ideas. The app is runable on any
Webserver including a local installation on XAMPP or similar.
The development was freezed as there were other projects 
that called attention. The application includes an over all
search as well as tag-list and tag-cloud. In the difference
the tag-list is a simple mention whereas the tag-cloud
has a weight in size, how often the tag is used.
Would be nice if someone does find errors and tell me.
Have fun.
