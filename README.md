little FAQ in Perl, not all errors tilt 
-- This should really be a very small FAQ app for someone
who wants to save some ideas. The app is runable on any
Webserver including a local installation on XAMPP or similar.
Not all errors were solved yet. The development was freezed
as there were other projects that called attention.
Would be nice if someone does find errors and tell me.
Have fun.
