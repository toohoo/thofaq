  This should really be a very small FAQ app for someone  
who wants to save some ideas. The app is runable on any  
Webserver including a local installation on XAMPP on Windows  
or similar. The development is not going continiously as  
might be expected. The application includes an over all  
search as well as tag-list and tag-cloud. In the difference  
the tag-list is a simple mention whereas the tag-cloud  
has a weight in size, how often the tag is used. The data  
are - at the moment - viewable by everyone but editable  
only from registered users.  
Would be nice if someone does find errors and tell me.  
Have fun.  

**I18n / multi-language**  

The app is multi language able. It was originally written in  
German. A language-file for english is included. For other    
languages the app is extensible.

**Attention**  

For use immediately on Windows there is set  
a shebang for correctly work with XAMPP on Windows. The  
assumed prerequest is XAMPP on drive D and perl in  

`/xampp/perl/bin/perl`  

To run it on Linux/Unix just remove the first line at  
the perl scripts.  
The app is tested under Linux/Windows/Raspbian (RaspberryPi).
